# GPM's Build Specification
# This format is intended to be used for repos which do not create releases
# You can provide the commands on how to build from source for target platform
# Make sure you put this file in the root of your repo.

# GPM even supports updating these type of repos by comparing the commit hashes.

# Build from source process 
# if building is common to all platform use the [any] key or provide commands for each platform you target,
# instead of any use one of 
# 'windows', 'macos', 'linux', 'debian', 'fedora', 'arch' or 'other'
# the 'other' key should only be used for a platform other than the supported ones
build:
  windows: flutter pub get
  flutter build exe --release


# !! IMPORTANT !!
# Make sure that after the build process finishes you should have an executable file with the name of the repo at your project's root
# Example: after executing the build process of (say) chat_desk, then, there should be an executable file at the root
